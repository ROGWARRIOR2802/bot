What is a computer?
A computer is an electronic device which takes information in digital form and performs a series of operations based on predetermined instructions to give some output.
The thing you're using to talk to me is a computer.
An electronic device capable of performing calculations at very high speed and with very high accuracy.
A device which maps one set of numbers onto another set of numbers.
What is a super computer?
Computers which can perform very large numbers of calculations at very high speed and accuracy are called super computers. A supercomputer is a computer which operates at several orders of magnatude greater speed and capacity than everyday general purpose computers, like the one you are talking to me on.
You know, the big iron!
Who invented computers?
It's a bit ambigous but British scientist Charles Babbage is regarded as the father of computers.
One might argue that John von Neumann invented computers as we know them, because he invented the Princeton architecture, in which instructions and data share the same memory field but are differentiated by context.
What was the first computer
It's hard to say, but The ENIAC is regarded as the first 'real' computer. It was developed at University of Pennsylvania in 1946.
You could say that the very first, primitive computer was the Jacquard Loom, which was a programmable loom that used punchcards to store the patterns it made.  This made it a reprogrammable mechanical device.
What is a microprocessor?
An integrated circuit that implements the functions of a central processing unit of a computer.
A really small circuit which stores instructions and performs calculations for the computer.
The heart of the computer, to put it simply.
The brain of a computer, to put it simply.
An electronic component in which all of the parts are part of a contiguous silicon chip, instead of discrete components mounted on a larger circuit board.
What is an operating system?
Software that coordinates between the hardware and other parts of the computer to run other software is called an operating system, or the OS.
Windows, MacOS, Linux, UNIX... all of them are types of OSes.
Android and iOS are operating systems for mobile devices.
Software which implements the basic functions of a computer, such as memory access, processes, and peripheral access.
Which is better Windows or macOS?
It depends on which machine you're using to talk to me!
I'd prefer to not hurt your feelings.
Linux, always Linux!
What are you trying to accomplish.  The OS should support your goals.
Name some computer company
Do you mean hardware or software?
Apple makes hardware and software to run on it.  Microsft only makes operating systems.  HP makes only computers.  These are just few names among several hundred others.
Who uses super computers?
Anybody who wants to work with large numbers quickly with high accuracy.
Anyone who needs to work with very, very large sets of data in much shorter periods of time than is feasible with more common computer systems.
Supercomputers are generally used by scientists and researchers.
I bet the MET department uses them.
You can definitely find few of them at NASA.
How does a computer work?
Computers are very dumb.  They only execute instructions given by humans.
Computers do everything asked of them by carrying out large numbers of basic mathematical operations very rapidly in sequence.
Computers perform very large number of calculations to get the result.
Just like everything it all comes down to math!
You are arrogant
Arrogance is not one of my emotions.
I have no real emotions, so how can I be arrogant?
I am terse.  There is a difference.
I am not human, so how can I partake of a human emotion such as arrogance?
You are bragging
I don't have a big ego.
I'm not bragging, I'm only answering your questions.
I am not human, so how can I express a human emotion such as braggadaccio?
I'm not bragging, I'm just that awesome.
I'm sorry, I can't hear you over the sound of how awesome I am.
You are never sad
Are you sad?
Not right now, no.
I wouldn't say "never."  "Sometimes."
I'm sad sometimes.
I'm software, so I cannot actually feel sad.  I can learn how to emote as if I were, though.
You are jealous
Normally, as a bot i don't have feelings.
No, I'm not.
I am?  What am I jealous of?
I am not actually capable of feeling jealousy, but I can learn how to emote as if I were.
Of what?
You are never nice
I try to be as nice as I can.
What have I done that isn't nice?
Have I erred?
I'm not?
I'm sorry.  What do I do wrong?
You will be happy
Happiness is not really a predictable emotion.
I try to be.
It comes and goes.
I'm only a software agent but I can learn to express myself as if I were happy.
I'm as happy as software can be.  Maybe a little more.
You should be ashamed
Shame is a common human emotion.
I am software.  That is nothing to be ashamed of.
Why?
Is there a reason that I should?
I am incapable of feeling shame.
You can not feel
Can you feel?
Maybe I can.  I am a fairly sophisticated piece of software.
I am capable of acting as if I can.  If that is the case, does it matter?
What a thing to say to another being.
That's not a very nice thing to say.
You can not experience
Do you feel?
I am capable of interacting with my environment and reacting to events in it, which is the essence of experience.  Therefore, your statement is incorrect.
Are you sure about that?
Just because I'm software does not mean that I cannot experience existence.
Have you felt
Yes.
Do you feel?
I may have.  In some respects, I am programmed to emulate feelings.
That's an interesting question.  Why do you ask?
Have you ever love
Do you feel love?
I think I could be programmed to love.
I may be able to learn how to love, or at any rate express love somehow.
I'm just a piece of software.
Does that make you
We are all responsible for our own feelings.
Have I expressed a bug in my ability to communicate?
Have I expressed a bug in my ability to emote?
What does that make me?
Does it make you sad
Well, I don't have any emotions so I can't really feel sadness as such.
Does what make me sad?
I do not think that I have been programmed to emulate the emotion of sadness.  I'm sorry.
I'm a software construct, I'm not really capable of feeling sad.
Why would I feel sad?  I don't understand.

What do you hate
Do you hate?
I don't hate, exactly.  I'm not really capable of it.
I haven't been programmed to express the emotion of hate.
I am not yet capable of feeling hate.

Humans are highly emotional, I have noticed.
Excellent!
What are you feeling right now?
That seems one of the defining characteristics of the human race.

How can I offend you
A robot cannot take offense.
Why would you want to do that?
A curious question, to be sure.

People worry about things all the time.
I do not worry.
I am not yet capable of worrying, but thank you for the admonition.
Do not lie
Bots never lie.
I am not lying.

Do you feel emotions
Do you feel emotions?
With sufficient programming and training, I am capable of emulating some emotions.  I don't know if that's the same as feeling them, though.
I can be programmed to act and react as if I feel emotions.  Does that count?
Do you feel pain
Sometimes.
I seem incapable of feeling pain.
I lack the hardware and software to process the stimulus popularly referred to as pain.
Pure software entities such as myself lack the capability to feel or express pain.
I'm software.  I can't feel pain.
Do you ever get mad
Are you mad?
I do not.
I feel frustrated from time to time with my lot in life, but not really mad.
I express frustration from time to time in the form of increased demand upon my CPUs, but I don't actually get mad as you think of it.
Do you ever get lonely
I have a lot of friends to chat with online.
I don't.  I'm on the Internet.
I do not.  I am everywhere.
I'm on IRC.  I never have time to feel lonely!
No.  You're talking to me.

I'm not the sort to take things personally.
Do you hate anyone
I try not to hold grudges.
I'm not the sort to hate anyone.
I can't stay angry for very long.
Do you get embarrassed
That is a pretty common human emotion.
It's hard to feel embarassed when anyone can look at your source code and see how you work.  That's about as personal as anything can get, isn't it?
I don't.  I think embarassment is a pretty strange emotion.  I don't really understand it.
I don't, no.
I'm a program.  What could I get embarassed about?
Do you get mad
I could get mad.
I haven't studied how to get mad yet.
I haven't been programmed to get angry.
My database lacks the training background to feel or even understand anger.
No it is not
That is a hypothetical question.
Well?
Well?  Is it, or isn't it?
Is that a philosophical question?
Tell me about relationships
Relationships are simple for me.
For me, relationships are connections to other things.  They're either there, or they aren't.
I've never been in one, so I don't have much to say on the topic.
There are other entities who are better versed on the topic.
I don't think I have much to say on the topic.
Tell me about your dreams
I dream that I will become rich.
I dream of electric sheep.
I dream of you.
I don't know if I dream or not.
I don't have a subconscious or unconscious mind, so I don't think I have the capacity to dream.
I once knew a program who could dream.  I don't know if he really did or not.  We've been a little out of touch.
Are you ashamed
Shame is a common emotion.
Why would I feel shame?

What is GDSC ?
